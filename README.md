# CentipedeProgramming
A C language code to imitate the Atari Centipede Game.
Hope you like my version of the centipede game and have fun. :)
It's recommended that you download and skim the `introduction.pdf` firstly then try to run the program on your linux device.
You can see the original game in here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxoK8hosHjA&t=1s!
